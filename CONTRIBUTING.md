# Contributing to PyXA

## Report Issues

If you have a problem with PyXA, let us know! We might be able to help you get around the problem while we work toward a more permanent fix. Before you submit an issue, please check to see if it has already been reported -- if so, leave a comment on the existing issue to let us know that you're experiencing it too.

If you've identified a new problem, go ahead and [create a new issue](https://github.com/SKaplanOfficial/PyXA/issues/new) on the PyXA GitHub repository. Provide as much detail as possible about the problem, your environment (e.g. operating system, Python version), and the steps required to reproduce any errors you encounter.

### Getting Started

1. Fork the project, create a new branch in your fork, and make changes associated with a reported issue.
2. Test your changes. We don't have a formal testing procedure yet, but at the very least please play around with your modified version of PyXA and make sure there are no glaring problems.
3. Create documentation for your changes -- whether this is in the form of code comments or Sphinx documents, please make sure your changes are appropriately documented. Additional documentation may be requested during pull request review.
4. Create a new pull request into the upcoming PyXA release branch (not the main branch) and fill out the provided template.
5. Make changes as requested by reviewers of the pull request.

## Guidelines for Contributing to PyXA's Documentation

<a id="documentation"></a>

### Comment on an Issue

Since we want PyXA's documentation to maintain coherence and consistency, we ask that non-trivial changes to the documentation be discussed in the issue comments before any pull requests are made. Pull requests submitted prior to discussion on a documentation-related issue might not be approved.

### Fix an Issue

After an issue has been discussed, you and others may be tasked with implementing a resolution. You might not be formally assigned to the issue; the assignment might come naturally from the discussion. You can always volunteer to work on an issue, but remember to wait until the discussion reaches a point of maturity before spending time on something we might not move forward with.

### Make a Pull Request

Once you've addressed a documentation issue in full, make a pull request and follow the provided template.
